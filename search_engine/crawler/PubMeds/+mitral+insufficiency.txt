We sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current surgical techniques for treating mitral valve insufficiency and the results of mitral valve repair at our institution. Between 1972 and 2017, 104 consecutive patients underwent surgical repair of congenital MV dysplasia-insufficiency at our institution. Among these, 59 patients presented with MV insufficiency (or prevalent MV insufficiency) and were part of the study. There was 1 early (1.7%) and 1 late death (1.7%). Survival at 5, 10 and 20 years was 98%, 98% and 94%, respectively. Eight patients (14%) required MV replacement for residual significant MV insufficiency. Freedom from re-intervention for MV dysfunction at 5, 10 and 20 years were 89%, 84% and 79%, respectively. Surgical techniques for treating mitral valve insufficiency must be tailored for each patient with the main goal of achieving a proper valve function, rather than a \"normal\" anatomy.

{"title": "[Modern mitral valve surgery]", "authors": ["W Bothe", "F Beyersdorf"], "text": " At the beginning of the 20th century, Cutler and Levine performed the first successful surgical treatment of a stenotic mitral valve, which was the only treatable heart valve defect at that time. Mitral valve surgery has evolved significantly since then. The introduction of the heart-lung machine in 1954 not only reduced the surgical risk, but also allowed the treatment of different mitral valve pathologies. Nowadays, mitral valve insufficiency has become the most common underlying pathomechanism of mitral valve disease and can be classified into primary and secondary mitral insufficiency. Primary mitral valve insufficiency is mainly caused by alterations of the valve (leaflets and primary order chords) itself, whereas left ventricular dilatation leading to papillary muscle displacement and leaflet tethering via second order chords is the main underlying pathomechanism for secondary mitral valve regurgitation. Valve reconstruction using the \"loop technique\" plus annuloplasty is the surgical strategy of choice and normalizes life expectancy in patients with primary mitral regurgitation. In patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, implanting an annuloplasty is not superior to valve replacement and results in high rates of valve re-insufficiency (up to 30 % after 3 months) due to ongoing ventricular dilatation. In order to improve repair results in these patients, we add a novel subvalvular technique (ring-noose-string) to the annuloplasty that aims to prevent ongoing ventricular remodeling and re-insufficiency. In modern mitral surgery, a right lateral thoracotomy is the approach of choice with excellent repair and cosmetic results.", "nltk_dict": {"basic_feature": {"num_sentence": 9, "num_word": 236, "num_char": 1386}, "freq_dict": {"beginning": 1, "th": 1, "century": 1, "cutler": 1, "levine": 1, "performed": 1, "first": 1, "successful": 1, "surgical": 3, "treatment": 2, "stenotic": 1, "mitral": 11, "valve": 12, "treatable": 1, "heart": 1, "defect": 1, "time": 1, "surgery": 2, "evolved": 1, "significantly": 1, "since": 1, "introduction": 1, "heartlung": 1, "machine": 1, "reduced": 1, "risk": 1, "also": 1, "allowed": 1, "different": 1, "pathologies": 1, "nowadays": 1, "insufficiency": 3, "become": 1, "common": 1, "underlying": 2, "pathomechanism": 2, "disease": 1, "classified": 1, "primary": 4, "secondary": 3, "mainly": 1, "caused": 1, "alterations": 1, "leaflets": 1, "order": 3, "chords": 2, "whereas": 1, "left": 1, "ventricular": 3, "dilatation": 2, "leading": 1, "papillary": 1, "muscle": 1, "displacement": 1, "leaflet": 1, "tethering": 1, "via": 1, "second": 1, "main": 1, "regurgitation": 3, "reconstruction": 1, "using": 1, "loop": 1, "technique": 2, "plus": 1, "annuloplasty": 3, "strategy": 1, "choice": 2, "normalizes": 1, "life": 1, "expectancy": 1, "patients": 3, "implanting": 1, "superior": 1, "replacement": 1, "results": 3, "high": 1, "rates": 1, "reinsufficiency": 2, "%": 1, "months": 1, "due": 1, "ongoing": 2, "improve": 1, "repair": 2, "add": 1, "novel": 1, "subvalvular": 1, "ringnoosestring": 1, "aims": 1, "prevent": 1, "remodeling": 1, "modern": 1, "right": 1, "lateral": 1, "thoracotomy": 1, "approach": 1, "excellent": 1, "cosmetic": 1}}, "abstract_exist": true, "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26907868/"}
