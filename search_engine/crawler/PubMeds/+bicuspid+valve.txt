Given the positive outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in low-risk patients, TAVR will become more prevalent in the future in the treatment of severe bicuspid valve stenosis. However, asymmetrical bicuspid valve anatomy and calcification can prevent the circular and complete expansion of transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs). In previous studies, examining the impact of elliptical TAV deployment on leaflet stress distribution, asymmetric expansion of balloon-expandable intra-annular devices was studied up to an ellipticity index (long/short TAV diameter) of 1.4. However, such a high degree of eccentricity has not been observed in clinical studies with balloon-expandable devices. High degrees of stent eccentricity have been observed in self-expanding TAVs, such as CoreValve. However, CoreValve is a supra-annular device, and it was not clear if eccentric and incomplete stent deployment at the annulus would alter leaflet stress and strain distributions. This study aimed to assess the effects of eccentric and incomplete stent deployment of CoreValves in bicuspid aortic valves and compare the results to that of SAPIEN 3. Leaflet stress distribution and leaflet kinematics of 26-mm CoreValve and 26-mm SAPIEN 3 devices in bicuspid valves were obtained in a range that was observed in previous clinical studies. The results indicated that elliptical and incomplete stent deployment of TAVs increase leaflet stress and impair leaflet kinematics. The changes were more pronounced in CoreValve than SAPIEN 3. Increased leaflet stress can reduce long-term valve durability, and impaired leaflet kinematics can potentially increase blood stasis on the TAV leaflets. The study provides complementary insights into the mechanics of TAVs in bicuspid aortic valves.", "nltk_dict": {"basic_feature": {"num_sentence": 13, "num_word": 268, "num_char": 1561}, "freq_dict": {"bicuspid": 6, "aortic": 6, "valve": 5, "congenital": 1, "cardiac": 1, "anomaly": 1, "common": 1, "etiology": 1, "stenosis": 2, "given": 1, "positive": 1, "outcomes": 1, "transcatheter": 2, "replacement": 1, "tavr": 2, "lowrisk": 1, "patients": 1, "become": 1, "prevalent": 1, "future": 1, "treatment": 1, "severe": 1, "however": 3, "asymmetrical": 1, "anatomy": 1, "calcification": 1, "prevent": 1, "circular": 1, "complete": 1, "expansion": 2, "valves": 4, "tavs": 4, "previous": 2, "studies": 3, "examining": 1, "impact": 1, "elliptical": 2, "tav": 3, "deployment": 4, "leaflet": 8, "stress": 5, "distribution": 2, "asymmetric": 1, "balloonexpandable": 2, "intraannular": 1, "devices": 3, "studied": 1, "ellipticity": 1, "index": 1, "longshort": 1, "diameter": 1, "high": 2, "degree": 1, "eccentricity": 2, "observed": 3, "clinical": 2, "degrees": 1, "stent": 4, "selfexpanding": 1, "corevalve": 4, "supraannular": 1, "device": 1, "clear": 1, "eccentric": 2, "incomplete": 3, "annulus": 1, "would": 1, "alter": 1, "strain": 1, "distributions": 1, "study": 2, "aimed": 1, "assess": 1, "effects": 1, "corevalves": 1, "compare": 1, "results": 2, "sapien": 3, "kinematics": 3, "mm": 2, "obtained": 1, "range": 1, "indicated": 1, "increase": 2, "impair": 1, "changes": 1, "pronounced": 1, "increased": 1, "reduce": 1, "longterm": 1, "durability": 1, "impaired": 1, "potentially": 1, "blood": 1, "stasis": 1, "leaflets": 1, "provides": 1, "complementary": 1, "insights": 1, "mechanics": 1}, "freq_title": {"transcatheter": 1, "aortic": 1, "valve": 1, "replacement": 1, "bicuspid": 1, "valves": 1, "synergistic": 1, "effects": 1, "eccentric": 1, "incomplete": 1, "stent": 1, "deployment": 1}}, "abstract_exist": true, "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34130079/", "code": "34130079"}

Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is prevalent in the canine, and most adult dogs develop some degree of mitral valve disease as they age, highlighting the apparent vulnerability of canine heart valves to injury. Myxomatous valvular remodeling is associated with characteristic histopathologic features. Changes include expansion of extracellular matrix with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans; valvular interstitial cell alteration; and attenuation or loss of the collagen-laden fibrosa layer. These lead to malformation of the mitral apparatus, biomechanical dysfunction, and mitral incompetence. Mitral regurgitation is the most common manifestation of myxomatous valve disease and in advanced stages, associated volume overload promotes progressive valvular regurgitation, left atrial and left ventricular remodeling, atrial tears, chordal rupture, and congestive heart failure. Future studies are necessary to identify clinical-pathologic correlates that track disease severity and progression, detect valve dysfunction, and facilitate risk stratification.

Although DOMV or BAV can be detected in some genetic syndromes, it has not been reported to simultaneously appear in Turner syndrome (TS). TrueVue, TouchVue, and TrueVue Glass are the latest technologies in advanced three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE), which is an important information supplement to two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) for the diagnosis of congenital cardiac malformations. Herein we report the novel use of the above-mentioned technologies in the diagnosis and evaluation of a rare, combined valve malformation. Meanwhile, we also reviewed the literature for cases involving both DOMV and BAV and their association with various genetic syndromes. Case presentation: We present the case of a 5-year-old girl diagnosed with TS because of a developmental delay. DOMV and BAV were found through echocardiographic examination. Three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography as well as a series of novel advanced techniques were applied to clearly display the spatial structure of all tiers of the mitral valve apparatus, aortic valve, and arch to facilitate an accurate diagnosis. Conclusions: This is the first case in which both DOMV and BAV were associated with TS.

However, there are apparently no reports comparing the following procedures: PVR using a bioprosthetic valve and PVR using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bicuspid valve. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of PVR for PR after ICR of TOF in our institution and assessed which of the two PVR procedures was better. Methods: From June 2008 to December 2017, we performed PVR for PR after ICR of TOF in 34 patients. Patients with the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery conduits were excluded. Preoperative and postoperative cardiac magnetic resonance imagings (cMRIs) were performed in all patients. The patients were divided into the bioprosthetic valve group (BV group, n = 17) and the PTFE bicuspid valve group (PTFE group, n = 17). Results: There were no significant differences in the preoperative cMRI data and perioperative factors between the two groups. There were no deaths in either group. Postoperative cMRI showed that the PR fraction and the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI)/left ventricular end-diastolic volume index ratio were significantly improved in both groups. However, RVEDVI was significantly improved only in the BV group. Re-PVR was required in four patients in the PTFE group. Conclusion: PVR using a bioprosthetic valve was more effective for PR treatment after ICR of TOF than PVR using a PTFE bicuspid valve.", "nltk_dict": {"basic_feature": {"num_sentence": 13, "num_word": 233, "num_char": 1282}, "freq_dict": {"background": 1, "excellent": 1, "results": 2, "reported": 1, "regarding": 1, "pulmonary": 3, "valve": 8, "replacement": 1, "pvr": 8, "regurgitation": 1, "pr": 5, "intracardiac": 1, "repair": 1, "icr": 4, "patients": 6, "tetralogy": 1, "fallot": 1, "tof": 4, "however": 2, "apparently": 1, "reports": 1, "comparing": 1, "following": 1, "procedures": 2, "using": 4, "bioprosthetic": 3, "polytetrafluoroethylene": 1, "ptfe": 5, "bicuspid": 3, "herein": 1, "retrospectively": 1, "analyzed": 1, "outcomes": 1, "institution": 1, "assessed": 1, "two": 2, "better": 1, "methods": 1, "june": 1, "december": 1, "performed": 2, "right": 2, "ventricle": 1, "artery": 1, "conduits": 1, "excluded": 1, "preoperative": 2, "postoperative": 2, "cardiac": 1, "magnetic": 1, "resonance": 1, "imagings": 1, "cmris": 1, "divided": 1, "group": 7, "bv": 2, "n": 2, "significant": 1, "differences": 1, "cmri": 2, "data": 1, "perioperative": 1, "factors": 1, "groups": 2, "deaths": 1, "either": 1, "showed": 1, "fraction": 1, "ventricular": 2, "enddiastolic": 2, "volume": 2, "index": 2, "rvedvileft": 1, "ratio": 1, "significantly": 2, "improved": 2, "rvedvi": 1, "repvr": 1, "required": 1, "four": 1, "conclusion": 1, "effective": 1, "treatment": 1}, "freq_title": {"outcomes": 1, "pulmonary": 2, "valve": 4, "replacement": 1, "using": 1, "bioprosthetic": 1, "polytetrafluoroethylene": 1, "bicuspid": 1, "regurgitation": 1, "intracardiac": 1, "repair": 1, "tetralogy": 1, "fallot": 1}}, "abstract_exist": true, "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34423465/", "code": "34423465"}

The bicuspid aortic valve is not a disorder confined to the aortic valve, but a spectrum involving the aortic valve, aortic annulus, aortic root, ascending aorta, and the left ventricular outflow tract. Different types of bicuspid aortic valves may present with distinct aetiologies and morphologies. The anatomopathological features of the bicuspid aortic valve have not been sufficiently elucidated. Differences in the anatomy of the bicuspid aortic valve could reflect different pathogeneses and different needs for different therapeutic approaches.
