Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is the most prevalent muscular dystrophy in adults and has a wide phenotypic spectrum. The average age of death in myotonic dystrophy type 1 is in the fifth decade. In comparison, myotonic dystrophy type 2 tends to cause a milder phenotype with later onset of symptoms and is less common than myotonic dystrophy type 1. Historically, patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 have not received the medical and social input they need to maximize their quality and quantity of life. This review describes the improved understanding in the molecular and clinical features of myotonic dystrophy type 1 as well as the screening of clinical complications and their management. We will also discuss new potential genetic treatments. Recent findings: An active approach to screening and management of myotonic dystrophies type 1 and type 2 requires a multidisciplinary medical, rehabilitative and social team. This process will probably improve morbidity and mortality for patients. Genetic treatments have been successfully used in in-vitro and animal models to reverse the physiological, histopathological and transcriptomic features.

DM disease presentation is highly variable and distinguished by differences in age-of-onset and symptom severity. In the most severe form, DM presents with congenital onset and profound developmental defects. At the molecular level, DM pathogenesis is characterized by a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism that involves the transcription of noncoding microsatellite expansions. These mutant RNAs disrupt key cellular pathways, including RNA processing, localization, and translation. In DM, these toxic RNA effects are predominantly mediated through the modulation of the muscleblind-like and CUGBP and ETR-3-like factor families of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Dysfunction of these RBPs results in widespread RNA processing defects culminating in the expression of developmentally inappropriate protein isoforms in adult tissues. The tissue that is the focus of this review, skeletal muscle, is particularly sensitive to mutant RNA-responsive perturbations, as patients display a variety of developmental, structural, and functional defects in muscle. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of DM1 and DM2 clinical presentation and pathology as well as the underlying cellular and molecular defects associated with DM disease onset and progression.
