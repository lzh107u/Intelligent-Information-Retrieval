{"title": "Atrial Fibrillation in the ICU", "authors": ["Nicholas A Bosch", "Jonathan Cimini", "Allan J Walkey"], "text": " Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50% within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.", "nltk_dict": {"basic_feature": {"num_sentence": 8, "num_word": 248, "num_char": 1420}, "freq_dict": {"atrial": 3, "fibrillation": 1, "af": 10, "common": 1, "arrhythmia": 1, "encountered": 2, "icu": 1, "preexisting": 1, "highly": 1, "prevalent": 1, "among": 1, "older": 1, "patients": 4, "chronic": 1, "conditions": 1, "risk": 2, "critical": 7, "illness": 7, "whereas": 1, "newonset": 6, "triggered": 1, "accelerated": 1, "remodeling": 1, "arrhythmogenic": 1, "triggers": 1, "acute": 3, "loss": 1, "systole": 1, "onset": 1, "rapid": 2, "ventricular": 1, "rates": 2, "characterize": 1, "often": 1, "lead": 1, "decreased": 1, "cardiac": 1, "output": 1, "hemodynamic": 3, "compromise": 1, "thus": 1, "marker": 1, "disease": 1, "severity": 1, "well": 1, "likely": 1, "contributor": 1, "poor": 1, "outcomes": 1, "similar": 1, "manifestations": 1, "organ": 1, "dysfunction": 1, "evaluating": 1, "immediate": 1, "effects": 2, "important": 1, "component": 1, "clinical": 1, "assessment": 1, "aimed": 1, "identifying": 1, "need": 1, "urgent": 1, "direct": 1, "current": 2, "cardioversion": 1, "treatment": 1, "reversible": 1, "inciting": 1, "factors": 1, "identification": 1, "may": 1, "benefit": 1, "pharmacologic": 1, "rate": 1, "rhythm": 1, "control": 1, "addition": 1, "associated": 1, "short": 1, "longterm": 2, "increases": 1, "stroke": 1, "heart": 1, "failure": 1, "death": 1, "recurrence": 1, "approximately": 1, "%": 1, "within": 1, "year": 1, "following": 1, "hospital": 1, "discharge": 1, "absence": 1, "strong": 1, "evidence": 2, "base": 1, "substantial": 1, "practice": 1, "variation": 1, "choice": 1, "strategies": 2, "management": 3, "describe": 1, "evaluation": 1, "based": 1, "propose": 1, "future": 1, "avenues": 1, "investigation": 1, "fill": 1, "large": 1, "knowledge": 1, "gaps": 1}, "freq_title": {"atrial": 1, "fibrillation": 1, "icu": 1}}, "abstract_exist": true, "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29627355/", "code": "29627355"}

Thus, in our daily clinical practice we will often have to manage and treat those patients. In order to assess and treat these patients, proper blood pressure (BP) measurement as well as detection of atrial fibrillation is mandatory. The use of oscillometric devices for home and ambulatory blood pressure measurements may accurately measure systolic but not diastolic blood pressure levels. Current guidelines suggest to palpate the pulse and perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) as well as a long-term ECG monitoring in order to detect AF. However there is evidence that: the use of oscillometric BP device with a specific algorithm for the detection of AF as well as the interrogation of a permanent pacemaker may further help physicians to reveal periods of AF. Finnaly, although guidelines suggests the use of specific drugs in order to treat arterial hypertension in AF patients, the main goal is BP control per se.
